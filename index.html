                            You enjoy playing games for the story and the experience. 
                            You're looking for a game that introduces new mechanics slowly and does not require precise technical input to complete the story.

                            Beating a game once is not enough. You long to take advantage of in-game mechanics to break the sequence of the game and access areas you're not supposed to be in yet.
                            You're looking to optimize and conquer each room to achieve the fastest clear time.

                            You find enjoyment in frustration. You long for the pressure of being near achieving a seemingly impossible goal and one small mistake can cause you to lose all your progress. 
                            You're looking for a game that will force you to master all the hidden mechanics and execute them flawlessly for a legendary victory.
